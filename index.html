	<p>„für gemäßigten Fortschritt in den Schranken der Gesetze und Universitätsatzungen bzw. -ordnungen.“</p>

	<p>Wellington Square Watch is a bureaucratic watchdog in the University of Oxford. It seeks to promote, through lawful means
	in the fullest conformity with the statutes and regulations of the
	university—<p>
	<ul>
		<li>academic freedom;</li>
		<li>the democratic usages of the university, including the
			powers of Congregation;</li>
		<li>administrative accountability; and</li>
		<li>sound governance.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Updates and statements.</h2>
	<p>23 January 2025 · Following a vote in Congregation, a working group was charged with the redrafting of the proposals. WSW will submit evidence (<a href="reports/2024/1/evidence.pdf">draft</a>) to the working group. In our view, the working group has made commendable changes: it is now seriously engaging with the text of the proposals, and has improved some of them. But much remains to be done. The current text could—</p>
	<ol>
		<li>prohibit singing in a college-organised concert if it would disrupt a nearby tutorial,</li>
		<li>prohibit a gay student from claiming to be straight to avoid outing themselves in a college bar,</li>
		<li>allow Council to improperly interfere in disciplinary bodies’ proceedings in individual cases or to imoproperly seek to procure a certain outcome by the inducing of their members by changing the rules of procedure, and</li>
		<li>allow seemingly arbitrary withdrawals of access to IT facilities even before disciplinary cases are properly heard.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>In light of these difficulties, the draft evidence makes a number of recommendations.</p>
	<p><a href="https://wellingtonsquarewatch.org/statements/11-june.html">11 June 2024</a> · Council concedes temporary defeat but is still in denial.</p>
